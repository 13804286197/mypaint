- update the tutorial

- add a preferences dialog
  - set maximum brush radius
  - set canvas memory limit
  - set canvas border outside visible window (in percent)
  - set "reallocate how much in advance" maybe?

- zoom-out only for viewing somehow?
  - do not resize canvas when zooming, only when moving?
  - must be changeable

? ability to snap curve points (would need a finer grid)
  - instead: a function "copy curve shape from..." / copy/paste
