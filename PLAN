- frame.
  - ("simulates" a finite canvas; infinite canvas alone is awful for artists)
  - visual only (do strokes outside anyway, might enlarge later)
  - enable/disable/move/resize
  - should be easy now, using Cairo

- preferences
  - allow some memory limit maybe
  - remember window pos or not (gimp has a nice ui for this)

- dedicated "slow random" input
  - or just "random slowness"?
    - could lead to unwanted correlations

- one-sided brush
  - brush that is hard to the right, soft to the left of the direction moving

- swap tools
  - "Apparently Corel Photo Paint uses spacebar for swapping to previous tool."
  - variants: tool history (like undo), skip tools not painted with, visually show tool switch

- allow dots drawing
  - a dot should draw even without motion
  - is dabs-per-second enough, or is dabs-per-dpressure needed?

- eraser side
  - associate eraser side of pen with white sharp ink eraser

- color mixer?

- more brush information
  - attach text notes to brush
  - attach a small demo-replay / demo image?
  - brush categories - put all inky brushes into subfolder etc.

- copy/paste mapping curve shapes?
  - buttons next to shape? shared "symlinked" shape?
  - the "custom" input partially solves this problem now.

- change brush size (not dab radius)
  - this includes brush dynamics
  - brush "scale factor" to make it behave the same no matter what zoom level
  - useful to compensate the physical tablet size (A4 vs A5...)
    to map "wrist motion speed" to "brush size" the same way for everyone

- allow non-circle brush shapes

- maybe avoid gaps when using the "offset by speed"
  - and add a setting to intentionally do such gaps

- layers
  - layer dialog (select / set occupancy)
  - painless layer-switching ui

- plenty of default keybindings
  - support non-conflicting keyboard shortcuts from as many other apps as possible
  - make sure (almost) all tablet buttons / stripes have some discoverable default function

- input devices
  - make buttons / stripes / scrollwheel configurable
  - allow zoom/rotate/brushsize/opacity modes as-you-move (as spacebar)
  - bonus points: allow to interpret mouse x/y motion as zoom/rotate/scroll etc.
  - allow configurable step sizes (for rotozoom keys, for scroll events or motion sensitivity)

- try auto-rotation (normalizing your stroke direction slowly) and auto-zoom (zoom on slow motion)
  - not yet, rotozoom is too slow for such interactivity right now
