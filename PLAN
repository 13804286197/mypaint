- add a preferences dialog
  - set maximum brush radius
  - set canvas memory limit
  - set canvas border outside visible window (in percent)
  - set "reallocate how much in advance" maybe?

- undo. (probably the most wanted feature, even if only one stroke)

? zoom-out only for viewing somehow?
  - do not resize canvas when zooming, only when moving?

- edit global pressure nonlinearity curve
  - maybe wacom tool? maybe for each brush?

- copy/paste buttons curve shapes 
  - buttons next to shape? shared "symlinked" shape?

- allow non-circle brush shapes

- button for fast GIMP in- and export, also a GIMP plugin if needed

- a visual border, so you can "simulate" a non-infinite canvas
  - because infinite canvas alone is awful for artists

- maybe should use log(speed) instead of speed - I think it reacts
  "too strong" to fast moves. Maybe make this an option.

- maybe avoid gaps when using the "offset by speed"
  - and add a setting to intentinally do such gaps
