- update the tutorial

- problem: no drawing possible after startup
  - seems to be a new problem, happens about 1 out of 10 times
    - roughly since I introduced zoom
  - both in the brush and main area at the same time
  - happens sometimes, neither mouse nor tablet will work
  - no input values are printed to stdout
  - load/clear works fine
  ==> looks like there are no (extended?) input events received
      - but stroke input, and mouse-down should still work then?

- add a preferences dialog
  - set maximum brush radius
  - set canvas memory limit
  - set canvas border outside visible window (in percent)
  - set "reallocate how much in advance" maybe?

- zoom-out only for viewing somehow?
  - do not resize canvas when zooming, only when moving?
  - must be changeable

? ability to snap curve points (would need a finer grid)
  - instead: a function "copy curve shape from..." / copy/paste
