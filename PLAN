- Display brush names in edit subwindow.

- load alpha png (convert)

- frame.
  - ("simulates" a finite canvas; infinite canvas alone is awful for artists)
  - visual only (do strokes outside anyway, might enlarge later)
  - enable/disable/move/resize
  - should be easy now, using Cairo

- preferences
  - allow some memory limit maybe
  - set canvas border outside visible window (in percent)
  - default canvas background color
  - zoom quality
  - remember window pos or not (gimp has a nice ui for this)

- dedicated "slow random" input
  - or just "random slowness"?
    - could lead to unwanted correlations

- one-sided brush
  - brush that is hard to the right, soft to the left of the direction moving

- swap tools
  - "Apparently Corel Photo Paint uses spacebar for swapping to previous tool."
  - variants: tool history (like undo), skip tools not painted with, visually show tool switch

- popup menu
  - pops up at mouse, showing four squares with icons (or with adjustments directly?)
  - click on one, the submenu opens (eg. change size, color, etc)

- allow dots drawing
  - a dot should draw even without motion
  - is dabs-per-second enough, or is dabs-per-dpressure needed?

- pen/eraser
  - real alpha erasing: make it a mode, not a brush option
  - recognize tool and asociate brush and color, as brushkeys do?
  - default to a white sharp ink tip on the eraser

- color mixer?

- focus on ink a bit more

- try to get the smear brush described by simastrick

- tilt support 
  - what can tilt be used for?
  - not much, IMO, I even guess it is just a technical by-product

- show brush radius
  - "some symbol to see the current size of the painting-tool"
  - (mouse cursor shape, like in the GIMP? A key to show/hide it?
    - a key to quickly blink the shape? hmm...
    - note: shape size changes quickly!
  "brief indication of brushsize onscreen (circle, on brush size change)"

- edit global pressure nonlinearity curve
  - maybe wacom tool? maybe for each brush?

- more brush information
  - attach text notes to brush
  - attach a small demo-replay / demo image
  - brush categories - put all inky brushes into subfolder etc.

- copy/paste buttons curve shapes 
  - buttons next to shape? shared "symlinked" shape?
  - the "custom" input partially solves this problem now.

- change brush size (not dab radius)
  - this includes brush dynamics
  - brush "scale factor" to make it behave the same no matter what zoom level
  - useful to compensate the physical tablet size (A4 vs A5...)
    to map "wrist motion speed" to "brush size" the same way for everyone

- allow non-circle brush shapes

- button for fast GIMP in- and export, also a GIMP plugin if needed

- maybe avoid gaps when using the "offset by speed"
  - and add a setting to intentionally do such gaps

- layers
  - layer dialog (select / set occupancy)
  - painless layer-switching ui

- plenty of default keybindings
  - check conventions of other apps and support as many as possible:
    - spacebar for moving (with hand icon)
    - ctrl-scrollwheel for zooming
  - do something with mouse scrollwheel (eg. rotation)
  - make sure (almost) all tablet buttons / stripes have some discoverable default function

- input devices
  - make buttons / stripes / scrollwheel configurable
  - allow zoom/rotate/brushsize/opacity modes as-you-move (as spacebar)
  - bonus points: allow to interpret mouse x/y motion as zoom/rotate/scroll etc.
  - allow configurable step sizes (for rotozoom keys, for scroll events or motion sensitivity)

- try auto-rotation (following your stroke directin slowly) and auto-zoom (zoom on slow motion)
