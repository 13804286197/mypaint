- add a preferences dialog
  - set maximum brush radius
  - set canvas memory limit
  - set canvas border outside visible window (in percent)
  - set "reallocate how much in advance" maybe?

? zoom-out only for viewing somehow?
  - do not resize canvas when zooming, only when moving?
  - must be changeable

? ability to snap curve points (would need a finer grid)
  - instead: copy/paste buttons next to curve shapes.

- allow non-circle brush shapes

- infinite canvas is awful (? why ?)

- button for fast GIMP in- and export
  - also a GIMP plugin, if needed.

- a visual border, so you can "simulate" a non-infinite canvas
