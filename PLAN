- zoom (2x / 4x / 0.5x / 0.25x)
- dragging the canvas with side-button

- easy updating of standard brushes (no copy to ~/.mypaint ?)
- remove drawing time from brushfile
- save brush order elsewhere (manual sorting only?)

? ability to snap curve points (would need a finer grid)

- brushsettings: mark "..." buttons red where something was changed
