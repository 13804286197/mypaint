- undo.
  - (probably the most wanted feature, even if only one stroke)
  - should be a lot easier together with layers

- layers.
  - alpha support (for both rendering and brush strokes)
  - rewrite the rendering code
  - layer dialog (select / set occupancy)
  - own image file format (instead of png)

- show brush radius
  - "some symbol to see the current size of the painting-tool"
  - (mouse cursor shape, like in the GIMP? A key to show/hide it?
    - a key to quickly blink the shape? hmm...
    - note: shape size changes quickly!

- frame.
  - ("simulates" a finite canvas; infinite canvas alone is awful for artists)
  - visual only (do strokes outside anyway, might enlarge later)
  - enable/disable/move/resize

- add a preferences dialog
  - set maximum brush radius
  - set canvas memory limit
  - set canvas border outside visible window (in percent)
  - set "reallocate how much in advance" maybe?

- dedicated "slow random" input

- tilt support 
  - I need someone with a tilt tablet willing to test it

- maybe should use log(speed) instead of speed - I think it reacts
  "too strong" to fast moves. Maybe make this an option. (or another input)

? zoom-out only for viewing somehow?
  - do not resize canvas when zooming, only when moving?
  - better do it right: do not allocate memory for white canvas areas.

- edit global pressure nonlinearity curve
  - maybe wacom tool? maybe for each brush?

- copy/paste buttons curve shapes 
  - buttons next to shape? shared "symlinked" shape?
  - the "custom" input partially solves this problem now.

- change brush without changin radius?
  - how? distinguish brush tip vs brush size vs brush dynamics?

- allow non-circle brush shapes

- button for fast GIMP in- and export, also a GIMP plugin if needed

- maybe avoid gaps when using the "offset by speed"
  - and add a setting to intentionally do such gaps
