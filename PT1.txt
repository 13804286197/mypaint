first order low-pass filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(Known as PT1-Filter, related to exponential decay) 

fac = exp(-dt*T1);
output = fac*output + (1-fac)*input;

dt: time passed since last calculation
T1:"time constant", think "time it takes to react". After this time time,
    2/3 of the difference between input and output is gone.

if the input is a position, then
filtered_velocity = input - output

(event-based calculation; in the not-event-based version, dt would be
constant, thus fac would also be constant.)
