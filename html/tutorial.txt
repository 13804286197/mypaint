==Tutorial==
Here I want to explain you how I use my program. My goal for mypaint
was "scribble without thinking". I want as little distraction as
possible from the painting process.

Mypaint can save/load .png only (without alpha). Use the
[http://www.gimp.org GIMP] for final touch up, cropping and all the
"manipulation" stuff.

==Keybindings==
[[shortcut.jpg|right|border]]
I paint with my left hand on the left half of the keyboard. That's how
the shortcuts are arranged. If you have changed them already, move
~/.mypaint/accelmap.conf out of the way and restart.

Now open the '''File''' menu and move your mouse over the
'''Clear''' entry. Press the '''3''' key. That was easy! Now you
can get rid of your image quickly. Why '''3''', you might ask? Because
it is easily reachable with your left hand, and most other keys are in
use already. In fact, '''3''' was in use too, if you look at the
'''Brushkeys''' menu.

==Brush Size==
To increase the size of the brush, press the '''F''' key a few times
while drawing. Press the '''D''' key to make it smaller.  Try to use
those keys instinctively.

Note that many brushes alter their settings depending on how fast you
move. Because "fast" is relative to the brush radius, you might notice
other changes than a different size. And many brushes get bigger when
you move faster. Try to use this effect instead.

==Change the Color==
[[color.jpg|right]]
Press the '''C''' key to open the GTK color dialog. Choose your
color. Press '''C''' again to get rid of it.

Scribble around a bit with your new color, then press '''V'''.  The
color at the center is your current color. The horizontal stripe
changes the brightness only, the vertical one saturation only. The
colors around will look different every time. This is a very fast way
to get shades of one color. I prefer it over the GTK dialog.
Sometimes I even open it, choose a color, open it again, until I end up
with a completely different color.

Finally, point at your painting and press the '''R''' key. This picks
the color at the cursor - no mouse click is needed. This is even
faster, but you get no color variation.

==Infinite Canvas==
The border of the screen is not the end. The canvas is always a little
bit bigger than this and will grow when you resize the window, or move
around. The keys are in the '''File''' menu. Try them now. Memory usage
will increase, moving around will get slower, but not painting.

==The Brush Dialog==
The white space at the bottom of the graphical brush list is for
trying out your brush. Use it a bit. But if you press the '''3''' key
your main image will get cleared - you have to use the clear
button at the right. 

[[redbrush.jpg|right|border]]

Now it's time to change your brush. Choose the red one at the
top. When you start mypaint, the brush list gets sorted by how often
you use them. This must be one of my favourites. Click on it once more
- this will show you a bigger preview image. Try it a bit, I think it
is a good one.

The first thing to notice is that it gets more randomness when you
increase pressure. Also, it will grow when you move around faster. And
the brightness changes. It will always draw with a color a bit
darker than what you selected.

==Create your own brush==
Let's say you like this brush, but not the fact that the color gets
darker. Open the '''brush settings''' window from the '''Dialogs'''
menu. So many settings! I have to admit that I don't remember what
some of them do myself. Look at the tooltip info for '''color
brightness''' at the bottom. That must be it! But why is it at zero?
Well what you see here is the '''base value''', independent of speed,
pressure, whatever. Change it until it shows '''2.0'''. Use the GTK
Color dialog to switch to black and draw a bit.

[[byrandom.jpg|right|border]]
OK, that was too much, and it still does change with speed! Click on
the red brush again to restore the original settings. Click on the two
dots '''...''' right to the '''color brightness''' slider. Move the
'''by random''' slider to the maximum, just for fun, and try your
brush. Open the details for '''by pressure''', to see how this
works. You could increase the base value a bit to make the brush
brighter on average. But now press all the zero buttons to get rid of
this stuff completely. Try it, it did actually work. 

(There is no need to alter the curve you see at '''by random'''
because its y-range now goes from zero to zero. This curve will not be
saved any more with your brush because it has no effect.)

==Save your new brush==
Easy. In the brush dialog, click on '''add as new'''.
Your new brush is at the upper left corner (the position will change
the next time you start). But it needs a different image! Press
'''clear''' and draw something that both shows your brush and is easy
to recognize. Then press '''update preview'''. If you improve the
brush settings even more, remember to '''update settings''' before you
switch to another brush or quit.

It is also possible to draw the preview image with a different
brush. Remember: click once to select a brush, click again to load its
image.

==Share your brush==
This goes manually, sorry about that. Look at the directory
~/.mypaint/brushes/, use the png images to find the number of your
brush. You can rename those files, as long as you keep the .myb
extension mypaint will find them. Only the b???.myb file is important,
but you better get the _prev.png too for a nice preview.  Wow,
somebody is actually reading all this stuff! Well, if you ever come up
with an own brush (or a whole collection) that you like and use often,
please drop me an email. I will publish it on the homepage and maybe
include it into the next version.
