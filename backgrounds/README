Backgrounds are used by MyPaint to define how the canvas looks. 
They can be selected from the Layers->Background... menu. 

You can create your own Background in this folder. 

 - Create (e.g. using GIMP) an image of size exactly 
   64*N x 64*M (in other words, 64x64, 128x128, 192x192, 256x256, 
   320x320, ... 640x640, ... etc). 
 - Create the tile graphics. Remember that it should look good  
   when placed next to itself over and over in all directions. 
 - Give it a good name and save it as a PNG image *without* 
   alpha channel and put it in this folder
 - Restart MyPaint.
